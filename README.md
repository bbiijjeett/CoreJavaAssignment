**Task 1: Setup and Maven Configuration:**
- Initialize a new Maven project and set up project structure for a web application.
- Define dependencies for Servlets, JSP, and JDBC within the Maven pom.xml file.
**Task 2: Database Interaction**
- Design and create a simple relational database schema (e.g., for a library, online store, etc.)
using SQL basics.
- Implement Java classes using JDBC to establish a connection to the database and perform
CRUD operations.
**Task 3: Servlets and JSP Implementation**
- Create Servlets to handle HTTP requests and responses, interacting with the database
through JDBC.
- Develop JSP pages for presenting dynamic content retrieved from Servlets and enabling user
interaction.
**Task 4: Integration and Version Control**
- Integrate all components (Servlets, JSP, Java classes) into the Maven project, ensuring
seamless functionality.
- Initiate a Git repository, commit the project files, and push the code to GitHub for version
control
